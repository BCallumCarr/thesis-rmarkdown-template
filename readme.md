This is a template designed for a dissertation/thesis, or maybe even a fancy essay. It requires [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) be installed, as well as knowledge of "coding" in RMarkdown and Latex. It would also help if you knew how to navigate a `.tex` file to fix some niggly issues when knitting (compiling) this. It *is* a work in progress, so please contact me if you have any suggestions/comments!

PS: Make sure to keep `git pull`ing to get updates on the template.
